        Altify automizes the task of inserting alternative text attributes for
        image tags. Altify uses Microsoft Computer Vision API's deep learning
        algorithms to caption images in an HTML file and returns a new HTML file
        in which alt attributes are filled out with their corresponding
        captions.
        
        Notice: Altify will now ignore any image tag whose alt attribute has
        content or is just an empty string. (In compliance with standard web
        practices)

        1. Parses the html using BeautifulSoup.
        2. Finds all the image tags.
        3. Sends a request to Microsoft's API to caption.
        4. Fills out the alt attributes for all the images.
        5. Writes an edited HTML file next to the file you selected.
